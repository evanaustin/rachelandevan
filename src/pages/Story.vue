      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        We happened to meet in early 2018 at our local climbing gym &mdash;
        introduced to one another by a mutual acquaintance. We clicked right
        away and became fast friends. Fueled by our passion and love for
        climbing, we found ourselves hanging out (and crushing it) on the
        regular at the gym and outside &mdash; traveling as far as Bishop, CA to
        endure 6Âº nights and camp out in tents in the name of some good climbing
        (and good company). Mix in some more traditional (albeit accidental)
        dates here and there, and before we knew it we were head over heels for
        each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mere days into 2019, we were officially in a relationship and off to the
        moon. Over the year, climbing gradually gave way to other cherished
        activites like paddleboarding, boxing, and cooking. We traveled to the
        Great Lakes of Michigan, Asheville, the New River Gorge, Moore's Wall in
        North Carolina, and again back West - this time to Las Vegas (not for
        anything unscrupulous &mdash; just for climbing ðŸ˜‰).
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout our relationship and especially in 2020, it would be easy to
        highlight endless challenges (renovating a 110-year-old house, running a
        business, frequent job changes, a little pandemic called COVID-19, etc.
        etc. etc. &hellip;) as the hallmark of our relationship. However, it's
        far more honest to consider our unrelenting drive, ambition, evergrowing
        admiration for one another, and the ability to truly listen that has
        bonded us together over the past three years. All of that was true on
        Day 1 and has only become more real along the way. We fuel each other's
        fires.
      </p>

        For Rachel, Evan had a way of listening to and engaging in conversations about life that helped Rachel process the various situations and struggles she was facing during 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Evan, Rachel had a way of slipping through his walls so that he would gradually open up and be himself in a way that was rarely shared with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout our friendship and eventual relationship, each of us was always <u>so</u> in tune with the other that we knew what the other was thinking and feeling &mdash; without it actually being verbalized.
      </p>
			<p>
        Rachelâ€™s mom and coworkers seemed to know "something was up" toward the end of 2018 between her and Evan. Rachel claims to subconsciously have known as well, but didnâ€™t fully "own" that feeling until December.
			</p>
      <p>
        More or less inseparable since we first met, we finally elevated our friendship to the next level with our first formal date that mid-December of 2018. After that date, we decided that we wanted to be in an bona fide relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past couple years of our relationship and inevitable engagenement, each of us has challenged the other to grow, question, and explore life, and we look forward to continue growing together forever.
      </p>

        <strong>Rachel:</strong> "Life is an adventure; a journey. We are to 'run the race with perseverance...fixing our eyes on Jesus (Heb. 12:2),' and there is no one Iâ€™d rather be able to turn to, look at, and see running beside me, than Evan Austin. Iâ€™m so excited to embark on the journey the Lord has created for me and 'the one whom my soul loves (Song of Solomon 3:4).'"
